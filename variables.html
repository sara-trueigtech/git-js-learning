      They are used to declare variables (store data). But they differ in: Scope
      Reassignment Hoisting Safety

    <p>
      Why var is avoided in modern JS ? No block scope, Can be redeclared, Leads
      to unpredictable bugs, Breaks large applications. React NEVER uses var

    <p>
      const means constant reference, not constant value.Cannot reassign, But
      mutation IS allowed. Reference same, Internal data changed. Reassignment
      not allowed.
    </p>
    <p>let and const are block-scoped, var is function-scoped.</p>
    <p>
      const is preferred in React because it prevents reassignment and promotes predictable, immutable patterns
    </p>
    <p>in react we have states, State updates via functions, not reassignment</p>
    <p>The bug in var happens because var is function-scoped and creates a single shared variable, while let is block-scoped and creates a new variable for each iteration, which closures capture correctly.</p>
