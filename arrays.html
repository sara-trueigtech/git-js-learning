    <p>
      An array is a non-primitive (reference) data type used to store multiple
      values in a single variable. Maintain order Use indexing (starts from 0)
      Can store any data type
    </p>
    <p>
      What map() Does Iterates over array Returns a new array Does not mutate
      original array
    </p>

    <ul id="list"></ul>

    <p>
      What filter() Does Returns elements that satisfy a condition Returns a new
      array Does not mutate original array
    </p>

    <ul id="evenList"></ul>

    <p>
      What find() Does Returns first matching element Returns a single value
      (not array) Returns undefined if not found. find() returns the first
      element in an array that matches a condition
    </p>

    <input id="numInput" placeholder="Enter number" />
    <button id="search">Find</button>
    <p id="result"></p>

    <p>
      What reduce() Does Reduces array to one single value Can return: Number
      Object Array
    </p>
    <p>
      array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => { return newAccumulator; },
      initialValue);
    </p>

    <p>
      A function to execute for each element in the array. Its return value
      becomes the value of the accumulator parameter on the next invocation of
      callbackFn. For the last invocation, the return value becomes the return
      value of reduce(). The function is called with the following arguments:
      accumulator The value resulting from the previous call to callbackFn. On
      the first call, its value is initialValue if the latter is specified;
      otherwise its value is array[0]. currentValue The value of the current
      element. On the first call, its value is array[0] if initialValue is
      specified; otherwise its value is array[1]. currentIndex The index
      position of currentValue in the array. On the first call, its value is 0
      if initialValue is specified, otherwise 1. array The array reduce() was
      called upon. initialValue Optional A value to which accumulator is
      initialized the first time the callback is called. If initialValue is
      specified, callbackFn starts executing with the first value in the array
      as currentValue. If initialValue is not specified, accumulator is
      initialized to the first value in the array, and callbackFn starts
      executing with the second value in the array as currentValue. In this
      case, if the array is empty (so that there's no first value to return as
      accumulator), an error is thrown. Return value The value that results from
      running the "reducer" callback function to completion over the entire
      array.
